- Request/response logging middleware
- Performance monitoring middleware
- Security headers middleware
- Health check endpoints
- Custom decorators for critical operations

**Key Features:**
- Structured logging with rotation
- Separate log files for errors and payments
- Request ID tracking
- Slow request detection
- Custom exception types
- Health check endpoints (`/health/` and `/health/detailed/`)

## Database Migrations Created
1. `orders/migrations/0002_order_session_key_alter_order_user.py` - Guest order support
2. `payments/migrations/0002_alter_payment_user.py` - Guest payment support

## New Utilities Added
- `utils/exceptions.py` - Custom exception handler and error classes
- `utils/decorators.py` - Logging and retry decorators
- `utils/middleware.py` - Request logging and error handling middleware
- `utils/views.py` - Health check endpoints
- `cart/middleware.py` - Session persistence middleware

## Testing
- Payment integration tests: `payments/tests.py`
- Order tracking tests: `orders/test_tracking.py`
- Cart persistence tests: `cart/tests.py`
- Email test command: `python manage.py test_email`

## Configuration Updates
- Added comprehensive logging configuration
- REST Framework configuration with custom exception handler
- Rate limiting configuration
- Security headers

## Next Steps (Phase 2)
The frontend specialist should work on:
1. Complete checkout flow UI/UX
2. Implement order tracking page
3. Add loading states and error boundaries
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Fix any broken navigation flows

## Important Notes
1. Stripe keys need to be configured in environment variables
2. Email settings need Gmail app password
3. Database migrations need to be applied
4. Logs directory will be created automatically
5. Health check available at `/health/` and `/health/detailed/`
